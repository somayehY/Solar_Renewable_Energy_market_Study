# Solar_Renewable_Energy_market_Study

Pennsylvania is one of a number of U.S. states which provide incentives for the generation of electricity by solar energy through Solar Renewal Energy Credits (SRECs). This study develops a return on investment model for solar energy generation in the PJM (mid-Atlantic) region of the U.S. Model results indicate that previous capital investments in solar generation have been stranded due to steep declines in the value of SRECs. A simple conceptual supply and demand model is developed to explain the sharp decline in market prices for SRECs and a possible policy remedy that would provide more graduate price signals to the market is discussed.
